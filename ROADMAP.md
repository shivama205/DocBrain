# DocBrain Enhancement Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned enhancements to DocBrain's RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities, inspired by advanced techniques from other implementations like DeepSeek-RAG-Chatbot.

## Phase 1: Core RAG Improvements

### 1. Neural Reranking with Cross-Encoder

**Priority: High**
**Timeline: Q2 2025**

Implement a cross-encoder reranking step to improve the relevance of retrieved chunks before answer generation.

**Benefits:**
- Provides immediate quality improvements with minimal architectural changes
- Addresses a common RAG weakness: initial retrieval often brings back marginally relevant content
- Can significantly improve answer quality by ensuring the most relevant chunks are used for generation

**Implementation approach:**
- Add a reranking step after vector retrieval
- Use a cross-encoder model (e.g., `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`)
- Score (query, chunk) pairs and reorder chunks by relevance
- Fall back gracefully if reranking fails

### 2. Hybrid Retrieval (BM25 + Vector Search)

**Priority: Medium**
**Timeline: Q2-Q3 2024**

Implement a hybrid retrieval approach that combines lexical search (BM25) with semantic search (vector embeddings).

**Benefits:**
- Improves recall by capturing both keyword matches and semantic similarity
- Helps with queries containing specific terms that might be missed by vector search alone
- Particularly valuable for technical or specialized domains

**Implementation approach:**
- Implement BM25 search alongside vector search
- Combine and deduplicate results from both approaches
- Weight and rank combined results
- Optimize for performance with large document collections

## Phase 2: Advanced RAG Techniques

### 3. Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)

**Priority: Medium**
**Timeline: Q3 2024**

Implement the HyDE technique to improve retrieval for complex or abstract queries.

**Benefits:**
- Particularly effective for complex or abstract queries
- Helps bridge the gap between natural language questions and document content
- Can significantly improve retrieval for questions that require inference

**Implementation approach:**
- Generate hypothetical answers to queries using LLM
- Use these hypothetical answers to enhance retrieval
- Implement as an optional step in the RAG pipeline

### 4. Local LLM Option with Ollama

**Priority: Low**
**Timeline: Q3-Q4 2024**

Add support for local LLM inference using Ollama.

**Benefits:**
- Provides flexibility for users with privacy concerns or offline requirements
- Reduces API costs for high-volume usage
- Allows for customization of models based on specific needs

**Implementation approach:**
- Create abstraction layer for LLM providers
- Implement Ollama integration
- Provide configuration options for model selection
- Ensure compatibility with existing code

## Phase 3: Architecture and Performance

### 5. Code Restructuring and Optimization

**Priority: High**
**Timeline: Ongoing**

Refactor the codebase to improve maintainability, testability, and performance.

**Goals:**
- Implement clean architecture principles
- Improve separation of concerns
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Optimize performance bottlenecks
- Enhance configurability and extensibility

**Implementation approach:**
- Define clear interfaces between components
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Implement the repository pattern consistently
- Add configuration options for all RAG pipeline components
- Improve error handling and logging

### 6. GraphRAG Implementation (Optional)

**Priority: Low**
**Timeline: 2025**

Explore graph-based retrieval to capture relationships between entities in documents.

**Benefits:**
- Captures relationships between entities in documents
- Enables more complex reasoning about document content
- Improves answers for queries requiring understanding of relationships

**Implementation approach:**
- Extract entities and relationships from documents
- Build knowledge graph representation
- Implement graph-based retrieval algorithms
- Integrate with existing retrieval methods

## Success Metrics

For each enhancement, we will measure:

1. **Retrieval Quality**: Precision, recall, and mean reciprocal rank
2. **Answer Quality**: Human evaluation of answer relevance and correctness
3. **Performance Impact**: Latency and resource usage
4. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback from users on answer quality
